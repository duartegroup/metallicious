GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2021.3-MODIFIED
Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs-2021.3-GPU-plumed/bin//gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs-2021.3-GPU-plumed
Working dir:  /scratch/4468909.1.multiway.q
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nt 4 -gpu_id 0 -deffnm run

Compiled SIMD: AVX2_256, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see
log).
Reading file run.tpr, VERSION 2021.3 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 4 OpenMP threads 


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
